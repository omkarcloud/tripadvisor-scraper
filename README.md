    "description": "Perched high atop Pier 57, Miru is a rooftop Japanese listening lounge where all senses are enlivened. Carefully curated vinyl sets the tone, the skyline sparkles beyond the glass, and the food and sake transport you. Hidden above the bustle of the city, Miru offers a tranquil escape by day and a sultry, immersive atmosphere by night. The menu, led by Executive Chef Rick Horiike, draws from his deep Japanese heritage and impressive culinary journey. A Chicago native, Chef Horiike began his career in his hometown before making his way to New York City. Staying true to his roots, he rose through the ranks of some of the city's most respected Asian kitchens, including Nobu 57 and Morimoto. His refined take on Japanese cuisine celebrates purity of flavor, exceptional ingredients, and artful presentation, featuring hand-crafted sushi, shareable small plates, and dishes that pair beautifully with Miru's robust sake and cocktail program.",
